                <li>Go to the Model view, drag fields between tables to create a relationship, or use the Manage Relationships dialog.</li>
                <li>A calculated column is computed row by row and stored in the table, while a measure is computed on demand and used in visualizations.</li>
                <li>The CALCULATE function modifies the filter context of a calculation, allowing for complex aggregations and filtering.</li>
                <li>Use the TOTALYTD function in DAX, e.g., TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales[Amount]), 'Date'[Date]).</li>
                <li>Open the report in Power BI Desktop, click "Publish," select your workspace, and click "Select."</li>
                <li>Create roles in Power BI Desktop, define DAX filters for each role, then manage security in Power BI Service.</li>
                <li>RELATED is used to retrieve a value from a related table in a many-to-one relationship.</li>
                <li>Create a new table using DAX, typically with the CALENDAR or CALENDARAUTO function, then add calculated columns for date attributes.</li>
                <li>Filter context refers to the set of filters applied to a calculation, which can be modified by DAX functions like CALCULATE.</li>
                <li>Create a parameter using "New Parameter" in Power Query, then use it in your queries or measures to create dynamic reports.</li>
